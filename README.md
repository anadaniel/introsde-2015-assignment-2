# Assignment #2 from IntroSDE Lab
For this assignment I worked on my own. The URL of my heroku server is the following: https://anadaniel-introsde-a02.herokuapp.com/persons

### The Server
The requests 1-10 defined in the Assignment 02 description have been implemented.

### The Client
The build xml includes a target to run the Client part of the assignment that sends requests to my heroku server and evaluates them to determine if the requests have been succesful or not. After running the requests, 2 log files will be available in the root of the project that will include the logs for the requests sent using XML and JSON. 

### How to execute

```
  git clone git@github.com:anadaniel/introsde-2015-assignment-2.git
  cd introsde-2015-assignment-2
  ant start.client
```
